The goal of the solunar project is to provide an open source Solunar Tables prediction solution.
Solunar Tables are used to predict the most active days and times of day for fish and game.
It will be  useful for fishing and hunting.

Astronomical Algorithms are contained in the code, no API calls, makes for offline use.
